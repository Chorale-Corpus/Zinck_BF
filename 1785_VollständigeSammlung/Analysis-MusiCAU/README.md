## About

This corpus contains the original transcriptions of the *Choralbuch*. In order to allow correct analyzation with digital tools of MusiCAU the codes of the original transcriptions have been slightly altered (an article discussing this need for adjustments can be downloaded from our [outcome repository] (https://github.com/cau-mi/musicau-outcome), cf. A_ZGMTH_2024-03-15). For further information on sources, transcription process and more see the general README to this *Choralbuch*.

## Credits

MusiCAU was developed at the Musicological Institute at Kiel University. For further information on the people involved see CONTRIBUTORS.
The transcriptions were created and revised between January 2021 and September 2023.
